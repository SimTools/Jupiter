Example to create a generator file of the HEPEvt format 
to use for Jupiter.

Following files exist in this directory

pythia_main.F : 
  sample fortran program to write a generator file 
  of HEPEvt format.
  This uses PYTHIA 6.205 for e+e- -> qqbar event at 
  500 GeV.  Generator data is written in a file, 
  qqbar.dat

Makefile :
  A sample Makefile to create a binary. 
  Path to the CERN library must be defined properly 
  depending on your environment.

run.g4mac :
  Geant4 macro file to read the file, qqbar.dat




How to create data and run Jupiter

$ make
  -->pythia.exe is created

$ pythia.exe 
  --> qqbar.dat is created

$ Jupiter -f $JUPITERROOT/data/glddec05_2m.dat run.g4mac
